The React Social Network is an open source project relying on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) a powerful javascript library for building the user interface. In this project, I tried to show some features of react/react components as a social network. 
The structure of this project give the ability to developer to develop their project on their own idea and environment.

Since I started building this project I've planned to have a back end for this project so I haven't focused on performance until I build the back end and move some data procedure from end to back end. Therefore I need to change data structure and actions for [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).
For those who prefer writing code by typescript, now React Social Network support both javascript and typescript language.

## What is new?
### Structure
New structure could make the project easy to change and scale up.
There are three main layers:
 - [Core](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/core) 
   - [Domain](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/core/domain)
   - [Providing interface for data services](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/core/services)
 - [Data](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/data)
  - This layer provide supporting variety of data platforms such as [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), ... .
    - [FirestoreClient](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/data/firestoreClient)
    - AwsClient
    - AspNetClient
    - ...
 - [Components](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/tree/next/src/components)
  - This layer take care of user interface which on [React](https://reactjs.org) and in [react-mobile-social] on [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). It means **the only thing change here among these three layers on mobile app, is component layer**.

### IOC Container
  - Using [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) in project give us the ability to switch between custom dependencies easily. Specially for *data layer*, if you are the user working with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) you only need to call `useAws()` or using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) call `useFirestore()` in [SocialEngine](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/next/src/socialEngine.ts#L20) file.
### Features
  - [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) as IOC container
  - Add auto compile on changing code for `webpack`
  - Open browser on after compiling on `npm start`. You need to set `PORT=[PORT_NUMBER]` in [config file](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/next/docs/app/configure/development.env).
  - Add reset password, confirm password and authorizing by GitHub, Google and Facebook.
  - Add scroll auto loading for show posts and people pages.
  - Using [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
  - Some cool stuff :)

## Required Knowledge

I recommend that you get to know React before using React Social Network. React Social Network has built by React components, so understanding how React fits into web development is important.

(If you're not familiar with the concept of Single Page Applications (SPAs), head over to the [here](https://www.codeschool.com/beginners-guide-to-web-development/single-page-applications) for a quick introduction before you read on.

  Comming soon :) ...


## Roadmap
### Supporting diverse data platforms
   Platform  | Accessible
------------ | -------------
[Firebase/Firestore](firebase.google.com/cloud/firestoreâ€Ž) | :+1:
[Amazon Web Service (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) | On Developing :zap:
[Azure](https://aws.amazon.com/) | Future Support :star:
[ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) | On Developing :zap:
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

 Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 
#### Note

 - If you're using Windows you should install all node-gyp dependencies with following commands:

`$ npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`
and then install the package

`$ npm install --global node-gyp`


### Installing

1. Fork the [react-social-network](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network) repository on Github
2. Clone your fork to your local machine `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/react-social-network.git`

3. Choose and install your backend bfore installing UI

    [![Firestore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/next/docs/app/firestore2.png)](firebase.google.com/cloud/firestore)
    #### [Firestore Social Backend](https://github.com/Qolzam/firestore-social-backend)
      * Configure firebase:
        * Get [firebase config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
        * Create a folder in root folder `react-social-network` set the name `config` => `>react-social-network\config`
        * Create three files in `>react-social-network\config` set their name `development.env` , `test.env` and `production.env` => `>react-social-network\config\development.env` and `>react-social-network\config\test.env`
        * Inside the files, you should write some keys of firebase configuration (each file is depend on the environment you work in `NODE_ENV`. If you set `NODE_ENV=development` your project will use from [development.env](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/next/docs/app/configure/development.env) or [production.env](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network/blob/next/docs/app/configure/production.env) to config firebase but if you set it `NODE_ENV=test` it will use `test.env` in test environment):
        * [Enable Email/Password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth) sign-in on firebase:
            * In the Firebase console, open the Auth section.
            * On the Sign in method tab, enable the Email/password sign-in method and click Save.
        * [Enable Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart)
          * Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
          * In the Database section, click Try Firestore Beta.
          * Click Enable.
        * [Install Firestore Social Backend](https://github.com/Qolzam/firestore-social-backend)
      * Enable firestore dependencies
        * Go to React Social Network folder in `src/socialEngine.ts` write `useFirestore(provider)` to enable firestore dependencies!

    #### AWS Social Backend
      * Comming soon ...
    #### [ASP.NET Social Backend](https://github.com/Qolzam/aspnet-core-social-network)
      * Comming soon ...

4. Installing all nodejs modules:
  `npm install`
5. Go ahead ;)
  `npm start`




## Deployment
Follow [firebase instruction](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/deploying)
`firebase deploy`

  * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.
  * [Express](https://expressjs.com/) Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with superpowers. Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there.
  * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling code
  * [InversifyJS](http://inversify.io/) InversifyJS is a lightweight (4KB) inversion of control (IoC) container for TypeScript and JavaScript apps. A IoC container uses a class constructor to identify and inject its dependencies.
